# journey-to-mid

I started learning to code in November 2021. 
I self-studied for a few months @CodeWithMosh. 
I self-studied for a year with @ITCareerSwitch. 
I landed a job at REDACTED in 03/2023.
    
Its now 06/2023 and quite frankly I've silently struggled a hecking lot in this time.
Its taken me about 18 months of programming to realise that I'm an absolute novice.  
  
However, I'm survivng on the quote "A diamond is a chunk of coal that is made good under pressure.".

I've set out 4 Growth objectives for myself; 
  Git gud 
  Understand the code base
  Learn how to ask for help
  Learn how to deal with stress

I'll document my journey to Git Gud as a programmer (developer?), 
  but as for the the rest, that'll stay under wraps :)
