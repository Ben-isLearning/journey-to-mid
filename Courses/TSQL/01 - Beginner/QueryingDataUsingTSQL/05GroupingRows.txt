Tables store Granular Data about real world entities 
    Orders stores order details 
    Customers stores customer details 
    Items stores item details

    But no complex data so far. 

What is grouping good for? 
    Finding simple answers to intricate questions in our data. 

Grouping Rows 

    GROUP BY Country 
        Customer    Country     Group
        Jack        USA         1
        Kelly       USA         1
        Sunil       India       2
        Chen        China       3
        Bob         NULL        4

            Aggregate functions operate on a set of elements 
            & return a single value. 
                Ex: Minimum, Maximum, Average, Count 

    SELECT  Country, Count(*) AS NumberOfCustomers 
    FROM    Customers 
    WHERE   Country IS NOT NULL     << Only has access to individual Rows 
    GROUP BY Country;  

        Country     NumberOfCustomers;
        USA         2
        India       1
        China       1
        NULL        1


    HAVING Count(*) > 1

    SELECT  Country, Count(*) AS NumberOfCustomers 
    FROM    Customers 
    WHERE   Country IS NOT NULL     << Only has access to individual Rows 
    GROUP BY Country
    Having Count(*) > 1;            << Has Access to aggregated rows. 

        Country     NumberOfCustomers;
        USA         2
