            SELECT 2 * 7, SQRT(2) ~ Returned as 2 unnamed columns

            SELECT 2 * 7 AS Easy, SQRT(2) AS LessEasy ~ Returned as 2 columns with Aliases. 

            SELECT 7 / 2; ~ Will break 
                            
                            decimal(precision, scale)
            SELECT CAST(7 AS DECIMAL(5,2)) /2;          ~ is fine 

            SELECT CAST('20230121' AS DATE) AS JanFirst; ~ returns Aliased column "JanFirst" with date 2023-01-21
