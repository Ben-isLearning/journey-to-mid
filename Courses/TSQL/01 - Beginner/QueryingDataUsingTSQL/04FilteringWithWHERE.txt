NULL ~ The problem child of SQL. 
    Represents missing or inapplicable data. 

SQL 3VL Predicate
    True | False | Unknown 

    Any comparison of 2 unknowns is unknown. 
    Any comparison of Known to Unknown is unknown. 
    State predicate can only evaluate to true or false 

Logical Operators 
    ALL 
        X > ALL (A, B, C)           True when X > A && X > B && X > C. 
                                    If A||B||C is NULL, Result is Unknown.

    ANY/SOME 
        X > ANY | SOME (A, B, C)    True when X > A || X > B || X > C.  (?? || True == True)    (?? || False == False) 
                                    If A||B||C is NULL, Result is True or Unknown.
    
    IN
        X IN (A, B, C)              True when X = A || X = B || X = C. 

    NOT IN 
        X NOT IN (A, B, C)          True when X != A && X != B && X != C. 
                                        If A||B||C is NULL, Result is Unknown.

    BETWEEN 
        X Between A and B           True when X >= A AND X <= B 
                                        BOUNDARY VALUES ARE INCLUDED TOO 

    LIKE
        X LIKE (<pattern)           True when X matches wildcard pattern Always use brackets. 
                                        ((x > 5 AND Y IN (7, 9, 11)) OR (X = 4 AND Y Between 3 AND 6)) AND (Z Like 'AB%')

    EXISTS
        X == NULL ~ Returns ?? 
        X != NULL ~ Returns ?? 

        X IS NULL ~             True if X is null,  False if not,   Never unknown.
        X IS NOT NULL ~         False if X is null, True if not,    Never unknown. 

Filtering with WHERE 
    Row by Row evaluation 
    by 1 or more Predicates 

        WHERE Country = 'USA' 

        Customer    Country     Country = 'USA' 
        Jack        USA         True 
        Sunil       India       False 
        Kelly       USA         True 
        Chen        China       False 
        Bob         NULL        Unknown

        Only TRUE rows are kept for further processing.. 

        Customer    Country     Country = 'USA' 
        Jack        USA         True 
        Kelly       USA         True 

DEMO: 

    SELECT * 
    FROM Customers 
    WHERE Country IS NOT NULL; 

    SELECT * 
    FROM ORDERS 
    WHERE OrderDate BETWEEN '20230115' AND '20230130'   ~ Show orders with date between 15th & 30th

    SELECT * 
    FROM Items  
    WHERE Item IN ('Turntable', 'Amplifier');           ~ Show items listed 

    SELECT * 
    FROM Items  
    WHERE Item NOT IN ('Turntable', 'Amplifier');       ~ Show everything BUT items listed 

    SELECT * 
    FROM Items  
    WHERE Item IN ('%A');                               ~ Starts with A 

    SELECT * 
    FROM Items  
    WHERE Item IN ('%n%');                              ~ Contains n
