Gathering Requirements; 

    What is the Business Case? 
        "I need an application for the management of our inventory of ingredients, 
        so that we can continue baking our pies!" 

    Usually done by a Business Analyist. 
    
    Conversation between business owner & Buisness Analyst  
    
        What should it be named? 
        ~~ "Bethany's Pie Shop Inventory Management" 
        
        Who will be using it? 
        ~~ "used by inventory managers in the warehouse" 

        How do inventory manager work with the inventory? 
        ~~ "When a product is used, inventory needs to be updated to reflect the new situation" 
        ~~ "Some products are used per item, others are used per kilo, others per box"
        ~~ "We need to be able to see which products are low on stock, so we dont run out!" 

        ~~ "and it would be great if inventory managers can create new orders for one or more products" 
        ~~ "most of our products are purchased in USD, but others are in Euro, and some in GPB" 
        ~~ "We need to make sure not to order too many of a product, since we have a limited storage capacity" 

        ~~ "I may not have mentioned it; our inventory managers will also need to be able to add new products" (entirely new product, not extra stock)


    From this we understand that the app needs to...
        Work with Products 
        Produce exists in different unit types 
        Create Orders to increase stock of one or more 
        Products can have a Price in different Currencies 
        Add new Product 

    We need to model these entities...
        Products 
        unit Types 
        Orders 
        Price, Currencies


    **REQUIREMENTS WILL CHANGE!!!**
        OOP will make it easy to handle changes
