Exception Bubbling; 
    * >> means Calls 

    Method A    >>  Method B    >>  Method C 
                                            Throws Exception 
                                    Handles? 
                    Handles?    
    Handles?

    If no method handles the exception, then it bubbles all the way up to 
    the user, and then our app goes bang. 


    Method A    >>  Method B (try..catch)   >>  Method C 
                                                    Throws Exception 
                                                Handles? 
                    Handles in the catch     
    Handles?

    Method B does something in the try block to stop the Exception 
    bubbling further 

_________________________________________________________________________

try...catch...finally blocks need to be set out in most to least specific. 

try
{
    //Something 
}
catch (ArgumentNullException ex)
{
    //Handle ArgumentNullException
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    //Handle Any other Exception 
}
finally 
{
    //Always executes code regardless of error or success
}
