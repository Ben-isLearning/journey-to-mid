Why Handle errors? 
    To Prevent program crashing (duh)
    To prevent dataloss / cascade failures 

    Chance to fix/retry error 

    Present meaningful error & perform graceful exit 

    Opportunity to log errrs 

    ++helps to produce self documenting code

Ancient Way; 

    Using error codes ~ magic numbers 
    Hella gross switch statements 
    Errors don't bubble up. 
    

New Way (Exceptions); 

    Don't care about error / success codes 
    Don't need switches eveywhere 
    More readable
    No magic numbers 
    Exceptions can bubble up 
    Can catch exceptions higher up / in one place 
    Handle system errors 
    Generate exceptions from constructors.

Exception in a nutshell
    Objects that inherit from System.Exceptions 

    Generated with 'throw'

    Different classes represent different errors 

    Contain additional error inco 

    Different exceptions can be handled differently

Exceptions can come from 
    .NET 
    NuGet
    or custom
