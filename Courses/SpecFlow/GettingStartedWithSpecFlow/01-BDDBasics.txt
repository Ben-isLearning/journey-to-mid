Behaviour Driven Development creates a shared understanding of how an application should behave 
by discovering missing requirements, based on concrete examples. 


BDD Phases 
    Discover  (Specification by example workshop)
        Specify collaboratively with examples 
        >Overcome bindspots of unknown unknowns  

    Formulate 
        Write Gherkin test cases in natural language
        >Turning key examples into formalized gherkin examples

    Automate 
        Avoid regression by automating test cases 
        >Scenarios are turned into automated acceptance tests


    Discover 
        ~What do we need? 

    Formulate
        Scenario: Simple search 

        When I search for '.NET BDD framework'
        Then the list of found results should contain :SpecFlow

    Automate (just the when)
        [When(@"I search for '(.*)'")]
        public void WhenISearchFor(string searchTerm) 
        {
            var controller = new CatalogController();
            actionResult - controller.search(searchTerm);
        }
