What is BDD? (and how SpecFlow relates to it?)

    Behavior Driven Development; 
        BDD Scenario: bridge between requirements and the solution
        
            Req: The AC Requirement
                VV Make requirements testable 

            Scenario: User votes up a question
            Given a question asked with 2 votes 
            And the user is authenticated 
            When the user votes up the question
            Then the votes should be changed to 3

            App: The Functionality in the App 
                ^^ Make tests understandable    (Why is this test failing? Is it still required/relevant?)


    Gherkin Syntax: 
        Scenario ~      Title ~ identifies the Scenario ("the one where..." ~ Imagine a scenario "the one where X happens" ~ drop "the one where" hey presto, a title. )
        Given ~         Describes Context               (Arrange)
        And ~           Coninuation on Previous step    
        When ~          Acton that indicates behavior   (Act)
        Then ~          the expected outcome            (Assert)


    SpecFlow is a BDD framework for .NET ~ The official .NET Version of Cucumber. 
        Executes scenarios using the provided automation code. 
            Execution is done with help of execution frameworks (Xunit, etc)
            Automation is provided for the step (focus on Reusability)


    Behavior Driven Development
        is about understanding, documenting & verifying buisness requirenements 
        through ilistrative scenarios 


    Purpose of Scenarios:  
        A Scenario is...
            An illustration of the requirements         
            an automated test 
            a documentation of the behaviour    

            Implementation Phase 
                >Ilustration 
                >Automated testing 

            Maintenence Phase 
                >Automated Testing (once passed)
                >Documentation of behaviour (Finely tuned)
        

    Why do we need a Bridge between Requirements and Application? 
        Traditionally connecting Automated tests with the AC of the stories
        is incredbly difficuly. 

        The bridge provides;
            A Scenario to cover the AC 
            A Step Definition to define the automation code 
            The Scenario verifies the Production code 

        Discovery is turning an Acceptance Criteria into an Example 
        Formulation is turning an AC into a GivenWhenThen Scenario 

        The bridge validates the AC && Verifies the production code 
            

    Practices of BDD

        Discovery; 
            Shared understanding is establised through collaboration and structured conversations. 
            >Defining examples 
            >Gain better understanding of AC through illustrating Examples 

        Formulation:
            The examples of system behaviour are documented as scenarios 
            >Mould examples into GivenWhenThen based scenarios 

        Automation: 
            Scenarios are automated to be able to verify the behavior of the system
______________________________________
The BDD Process (Through an example)

    01- Pick a User Story   ~ Product Owner 
        Elicit and prioritize functionality 
        (What are we trying to achieve?)

            Story
            "In order to avoid posting duplicate questions as a user, 
            i want to get suggestions about similar questions i am about to ask"
            
            Background
            This is a feature we needed for long because there are too many duplicates 
            With this story we would like to have an initial simple version that we can refine later based on the feedback 

            Concept 
            Identify the related questions based on the same words used 


    02- Requirement Workshop ~ Whole Team 
        Explore and discover through examples 
        (Sprint Planning)

            (Prior to meeting) Product Owner Prepares AC 
                AC Based on Background, context & goals 
                if AC is met, job is done. 
                AC Should be provided, but be prepared for changes

                    AC From Story
                    AC1 > Questions with at least one common word should be suggested 
                    AC2 > Words should be matched in title, body and tags 
                    AC3 > Common English words should be ignored 
                    AC4 > Suggestions with more common words should be earlier in the list 
        
            (Example Mapping) Team goes through AC & Sets out Examples 
                Story informs AC 
                each AC, requires Examples of success & examples of failure 
                Questions arise from anything that isn't clear 

                    AC1 > 
                    Another question contains the same word;
                    Question in the system 1)"What is SpecFlow" & 2)"What is Cucumber?"    
                    User types "Best Specflow practices" 
                    => suggested 1) 

                    word match is case sensitive; 
                    Question in the system 1)"What is SpecFlow" 
                    user types "Best SPECFLOW practices" 
                    => suggested 1) 

                        Question arises ~ Should we limit the amount of suggestions? 
                            ~Yes! Great idea ~ Additional AC Added.  
             
                        AC5 >
                        Limit the suggestion list to 10 entries;

                    AC2 > 
                    The same word is in different fields; 
                    Question in the system 1)"What is SpecFlow" 2)Q2, Body: "I'm using SpecFlow" 3) Q3, Tags: "SpecFlow"
                    user types "Best SpecFlow practices" 
                    => Suggested What is SpecFlow, Q2, Q3 

                    AC3 >
                    Word "is" is ignored 
                    Question in the system 1)"What is SpecFlow" & 2)"What is Cucumber?"    
                    user types "what is the best SpecFlow practice
                    =? suggested 1) not 2) 

                        Question arrises ~ "How should we deal with words containing dashes like "Behavior-driven"?"
                            ~Good question - PO doesn't have an answer, needs to ask buisness *Red Sticky Note time*

                    AC4 > 
                    x

                (Example Splitting) User Story is simply too big, needs to be split! 

                    Can split Story into AC points & Postpone them untill the next sprint 


    03- Formulation   ~ Dev & Tester (Creating a single source of truth)
        Convert example to scenario

        AC1 > 
            Another question contains the same word;
            Question in the system 1)"What is SpecFlow" & 2)"What is Cucumber?"    
            User types "Best Specflow practices" 
            => suggested 1) 

        Forumation of 1st point in AC1 

            Scenario: Another question contains the same word 
            Given: there are questions asked as 
            |title            |
            |What is SpecFlow?|
            |What is Cucumber?|
            And the user is authenticated 
            When the user starts asking a question as 
            |title                  |
            |Best SpecFlow practices|
            Then the suggestions list should be 
            |title             |
            |What is SpecFlow? |

        How to batch? 
            Should I formulate one? 
            Should I formulate all four?

            Formulate easy ones first
            Formulate all user story?

            If two different scenarios look incredibly similar, 
                They can be made into a Scenario Outline 

        Should be saved as an xxx.feature file, 
            Which are Source Controlled 
            Should sit in the same Repo as the production code. 

        How to handle in-progress state? 
            Newly added scenarios should be accompanied by the @formulated tag (@ignore tag?)
            which indicates that they are not ready to execute yet. 


    04- Review ~ Whole Team 
        Get feedback on scenarios from buisness 
        Perhaps in a teams chat asking to look at the pushed Gherkins, 
        or even scheduel a meeting to discuss


    05- Automate ~ Dev & Tester ()
        Define step definitions 
        Fill the step definitions with bare bones ~ 
            The context, the base class, the services we will need, 

    
    06- Implement ~ Dev ()
